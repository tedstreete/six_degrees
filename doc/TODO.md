## 1. Weak links

How do we handle pages that act as a weak link between other pages? For example, the entry for "Wife" or Husband has both a link to a disambiguatino page, but also legitimate links in namespace 0 to other pages. Those other pages do not represent a strong relationship between any two pages using the word "wife". One possible approach is to teat any page that includes a link to a disambiguation page as a page from which no links should be followed.
